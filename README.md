# odin-recipes
This is my first HTML project since I started The Odin Project.

It consists in building a basic recipe website where the main index page will have links to a few recipes.

It will require me know how to create the HTML from scratch and how to use anchors to link to each recipe
It will also require knowing how to use other HTML attributes such as images
